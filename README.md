Welcome to the CIA!

Here in the CIA we aim to get everyone the level and type of information that they need. 

An introduction to git, setting up git, branching, pulling, pushing, etc, would be good. 

If we use gradle like I expect that we will, an introduction to that, the wrapper file, and whatever else should be in order. 

The list of topics in that email should be included.
	They should be linked to discussions, solutions, or informaiton about them. 

Basically, let's let this be the central knowledge warehouse that can be used to help others. 

I am also working on a series of articles, [A Quick Introduction to Big O](./bigOIntrO.md). It will cover things like [An Introduction to Algorithms](./algorithms/intro.md) as well as [some quizes](./quizes/psuedocodealgorithm1.md).

[points](./points/) is a place to discuss topics. 
[algorithms](./algorithms/) needs to be expanded a lot, with descriptions, examples, and quizes.
