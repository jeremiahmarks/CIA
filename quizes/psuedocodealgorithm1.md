If you read the article, you already know this, sorry.

Fizz Buzz is a childrens game where the child will start to count numbers, except for numbers that are divisible by three (which are replaced by "fizz") and numbers which are divisiable by five (which are replaced by "Buzz"). Numbers that are divisiable by both three and five are replaced by "Fizz Buzz".
