Welcome to the weird world of life where you don't have to be at the library to check out what you get. 

Yeah, okay, this is going to try and be short and sweet. 

1. I highly suggest downloading and then reading and working through [the book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). It is a part of their [full documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), which has several different engaging ways to learn (video, books tutorial) including several links to [external content](https://git-scm.com/documentation/external-links)
2. Here is a [cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) for commandline.
3. Ummmm.... [this](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) is what they are calling a cheatsheet for the gui version. 
    a. can I get a cheetsheet for the cheetsheet, please?

###What is a git?
You know what, before that...

#What is version control, and why is it the best thing ever?
You know how you may keep different versions of a file handy in case you need them later? (This is often done by adding a timestamp to the filename). 

Well, when you start to work with others that type of versoning evolves into a formal system so you can share work with others. 

There are two main aproaches to this, centralized and distributed. I have never used a centralized VCS, so I have no real understanding of the reasons that one would use centralized, other than on projects of immense scale. (Outside of the braking systems of modern cars, though, I cannot think of anything that large.) I can think of many reasons that you could want to use a distributed VCS, though. This allows a large number of people to work on integrated areas of the codebase at one time. It allows different parties to collaborate easily while away from the central codebase, 

###So... what is a git?
Great question! a git is a way of talking about files at different states at different times. You know, how about I just TL;DR [the professionals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
Basically, it is a series of snapshots. 

Imagine that a git is a panoramic image that you paint in your garage and display in your gallary.
